A script to log joins, parts, quits, kicks & nick changes in separate window(s).
It also has a "watched nicks only' mode that only logs for nicks you specify using a single window.
For this you must manually specify the nicks to watch separated by a comma ie: nick1,nick2,nick3 inside the script, no dialogs (yet).
Put the files in your scripts directory and then load the jpqlogs.mrc file.
Right-click in channel/status window for menu.
Right-click in any of the log windows for related commands.
